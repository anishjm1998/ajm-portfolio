          This is an excerpt from the book ‘Hyperspace‘ written by Michio Kaku rewritten by me in a simpler way.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Year 1945, On a rainy stormy night, A man appeared in front of an orphanage carrying a baby girl. He put the baby girl in front of the orphanage, knocked the door and left. One of the nuns opened the door, found the baby girl in front of her. She took her inside the orphanage.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          The girl was named Jane. Jane grows up in the orphanage. She had no idea about who is her mother, father, family etc. At the age of 17 Jane fell in love with a guy, they started dating. But their relationship didn’t worked out, they started fighting, arguing etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          One day she found out that she is pregnant with her boyfriend’s baby. When she told him about this, he left her. Jane gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. But someone broke into the hospital that night and kidnapped her baby girl.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          In the morning the doctors found out that Jane’s health condition is serious. They had to do an operation and change her gender to save her. Now, Jane became Jim.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          When Jim woke up, he got to know that his baby girl is kidnapped and he is not a girl anymore. Jim became an alcoholic and started spending rest of his life Drinking and Gambling in the bar.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          One day someone in the bar asked him about his parents and family. Jim had no idea about them so he became angry and got in a bar fight with that person, and he was knocked down unconscious. When he woke up, the old bar owner introduced himself as a Time Traveller and wants to help him. He took Jim to his Time Machine and asked Jim to travel back in the past and find about his parents and family. Jim travelled several years back in the past.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          But, there he found a 17-year beautiful girl and fell in love with her. But their relationship didn’t worked out they started fighting, arguing etc. and one day Jim found out that his girlfriend is pregnant.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Now he remembered his past and understood everything, that he is a time traveller, and the girl he is dating is none other than himself, but he wanted a better life for his daughter. So he broke into the hospital that night and kidnapped his own daughter.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
