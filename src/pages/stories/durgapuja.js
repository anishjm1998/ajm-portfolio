          For me, Kolkata is a beautiful paradox. Having lived outside the city, it has a way of enchanting you when you return. The warmth of the city, the bustling crowds, and the vibrant chaos are all part of the charm. And then there’s the food, the magical old lanes, and above all, the magic of Durga Puja.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Kolkata is a city where you can hear the seasons. And no season sounds quite like that of Durga Puja. These sounds cannot be explained, but can only be grasped by emotion and unreason. Kolkata likes to sleep and not be awakened because it likes to dream. But come a few weeks before Puja and the City of Joy wakes up to its full potential. For, Durga Puja is that time of the year when the city returns to itself. It is also the time when I embrace the excitement of the moment and the trepidation of attempting to pack a lifetime of memories into four sleepless days.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          As I sit here now, lost in the memories of those golden moments, it hits me that Durga Puja wasn’t just an event; it was a source of profound joy and life-long bonds. Over the years, people have moved away, responsibilities have piled up, and the world has changed around us. But when Pujo season rolls in, it’s like a time warp. We all transform into those wide-eyed kids again, buzzing with excitement and nostalgia. It’s like we’re reliving those cherished moments for the very first time. The echoes of our youthful laughter and the warmth of our friendship, they’re as strong as ever, untouched by time.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Just like every year before, this Puja arrived with the hope that it would outshine the last, a promise that it would be bigger and better than ever before. And every Durga Puja has taught us a simple but profound lesson – you never know who’ll be there next Puja. So, we soaked in every moment, embraced every laugh, and cherished every adventure. We zigzagged through the bustling lanes, held on to each other for dear life in the sea of people, and couldn’t help but get lost in the pandals’ sheer creativity. Laughter, banter, and shared secrets were our constant companions, as we explored the city together, our hearts swelling with joy, all while gorging on Phuchkas and Egg Chicken Rolls to our heart’s content.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Amidst all this animated chaos, we formed an unbreakable bond, turning our shared adventures into tales we’d eagerly retell next Puja. We knew that the future was uncertain, but in that moment, we created memories to keep us warm during the long wait for the next Puja. Such a wait is longer, harder, and much less fun. Sometimes you forget you are waiting at all. Until you can hear a particular season. Until you can hear Durga Puja.
