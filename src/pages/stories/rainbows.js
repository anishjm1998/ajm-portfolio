          Do you believe in rainbows in your life? They say you have to endure rain to see one. But sometimes, that rain turns into a storm. It feels like it’s draining you, maybe even killing you. But remember, the fiercer the storm, the more beautiful the rainbow. Eventually, one day you will look back and realise why the storm was necessary.

          Rainbows are rare, just like real relationships. I’m not just talking about romance, but friendships too. Relationships are complex; they mean a lot. It’s strange how you can go through life without needing anyone, and then suddenly, you meet someone who changes everything. They’re something new, something different. They make you want their company more than anything else. Even if you enjoy solitude, when you meet someone who makes you want them more than being alone, that’s special.

          In life, you learn that there are very few permanent people. People come and go, but only a handful stay till the end. Each person who enters your life has a purpose, even if they’re only there for part of your journey. When you’re feeling weak, sad, or vulnerable, and there’s no one to lean on, that’s when you really discover who you are. Life is like a tunnel, and right now, you might feel lost in the darkness. But remember, there’s always a light waiting at the end. These experiences teach you about yourself and remind you that, ultimately, you’re responsible for your own well-being. Even if you have close friends, best friends, or partners, in the end, you’re on your own. You have to take care of yourself, or life will leave you behind while others move forward. This is why I tell you that you need to go through the storm. These storms show you who and how people are gonna stay in your life. The light is often closer than you think. Don’t lose hope, keep seeking. And remember it always comes after darkness.

          You might be pondering a difficult decision you made, fighting with regrets and the repercussions it has brought. But consider the future: if you think your future self will regret this choice, it’s time to make adjustments. Embrace a bit of selfishness, regardless of the magnitude of change required. All these years, you’ve held back your tears, thinking they don’t matter. But they do. You’re meant to be special, and special people are always different. You’re meant to be a rainbow. In the end, it’s all about the choices we make. Own your decisions and stay strong. Deep down, you know what’s best for you. Choose it. When things get hard, only tough people keep moving forward. No matter how tough the decision, if it leads to happiness for your future self, take it. Look for the rainbow ahead, not the storm you’re in.

          I’ve always been good at writing and expressing my feelings through words. But at the end of the day, it feels like the writer is always writing about their own life and how they overcome challenges and helping others through theirs. Now that I find myself in a similar situation, I feel a storm brewing inside me. We often build walls around ourselves, running away from everything and keeping our feelings bottled up, believing we’re secretly alone. My storm has come, and I need to get through it. I see the darkness, I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I keep walking and walking, but where is my rainbow?
